This Chrome extension, **UI Bug Analyzer**, does **not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII)** or sensitive user data.

## Data We Handle
- The extension allows users to **manually upload images (e.g., screenshots)** for the sole purpose of analyzing them for UI bugs using the OpenAI API.

- No data is collected, tracked, or sold.

## Permissions
- We request access to the active tab and local storage **only** to facilitate screenshot capture (optional) and saving analysis history locally.
- No browsing history, personal communications, or user activity are collected.

## Third-Party Services
- The extension sends user-provided screenshots to OpenAI via a secure API to generate UI bug analysis.
- We do not control how OpenAI stores or processes that data. Please refer to [OpenAIâ€™s privacy policy](https://openai.com/privacy) for more information.
